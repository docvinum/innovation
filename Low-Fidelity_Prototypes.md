### **Low-Fidelity Prototypes (Lo-Fi Prototypes)**

#### **What Are They?**
Low-fidelity prototypes are simple, inexpensive, and quick-to-create representations of a product or interface. They are used to test concepts, gather feedback, and validate ideas before investing significant time or resources into development. These prototypes focus on functionality and user flow rather than design aesthetics.

#### **Key Characteristics**
- **Quick to Create** – They require minimal effort and resources.
- **Low Detail** – They lack refined visuals, animations, or interactions.
- **Inexpensive** – Often made with paper, whiteboards, or basic digital wireframing tools.
- **Easily Modifiable** – Changes can be made rapidly based on feedback.
- **Focus on Concept & Usability** – Prioritizes structure and user experience over final design.

#### **Common Types of Low-Fidelity Prototypes**
1. **Paper Prototypes** – Hand-drawn sketches of interfaces or workflows on paper.
2. **Wireframes** – Basic digital or hand-drawn representations of page layouts.
3. **Clickable Wireframes** – Simple digital prototypes with basic interactions (e.g., using Figma, Balsamiq, or Adobe XD).
4. **Storyboard Prototypes** – Sequences of sketches that represent user interactions or workflows.
5. **Physical Mockups** – Rough representations of hardware or physical products using materials like cardboard or foam.

#### **Why Use Low-Fidelity Prototypes?**
- **Rapid Testing & Iteration** – Helps teams quickly validate ideas before full development.
- **Encourages Creativity** – Stakeholders can focus on core functionality without getting distracted by visual details.
- **Reduces Costs & Risks** – Avoids wasting resources on ineffective designs.
- **Facilitates Team Collaboration** – Provides a tangible way for designers, developers, and stakeholders to align on goals.

#### **When to Use Low-Fidelity Prototypes?**
- **Early stages of product development** – To brainstorm and explore different ideas.
- **Before user testing** – To validate user needs and usability.
- **For internal team discussions** – To communicate concepts among stakeholders.

By using low-fidelity prototypes, teams can efficiently refine their ideas, ensuring that the final product is user-friendly and meets the intended goals before committing to high-cost development efforts.
